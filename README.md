# Quick Parsec

TL;DR: Parsec Gaming + Wake-on-LAN 

## What is this?

Let's consider the scenario where you have a headless PC. In order to connect to that PC, you might have to do many steps:

1. Turn it on (by pressing the power button or using WOL)
2. Open Parsec
3. Wait for the PC to be shown up in the list
4. Click on the "Connect" button

**Quick Parsec** will do these steps automatically.

## How to use

Download the app from [releases](https://github.com/ngxson/quick-parsec/releases)

Run `quick-parsec.exe`

## Available script

`npm run start`: Start debug app

`npm run build`: Build the app (right now only support for Windows x64)
